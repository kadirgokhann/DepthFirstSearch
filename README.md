Graph and Data Structures Project:

This project implements several graph traversal algorithms (DFS, BFS) and data structures like stacks, linked lists, and hash tables. The code is written in Java and includes a variety of classes for working with both directed and undirected graphs, as well as utility data structures to support these operations.

Features
Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Connected components detection
Stack and linked list implementations
Graph representation using adjacency lists
Hash table for fast lookup of graph nodes
Usage
The project includes various classes for graph operations and can be extended or used to solve problems related to graph traversal and data manipulation. The vectors.txt file provides sample graph data for testing.
